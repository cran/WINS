Description: Calculate the win statistics (win ratio, net benefit and win odds) for prioritized multiple endpoints, plot the win statistics and win proportions over study time if at least one time-to-event endpoint is analyzed, and simulate datasets with dependent endpoints. The package can handle any type of outcomes (continuous, ordinal, binary, time-to-event) and allow users to perform stratified analysis, inverse probability of censoring weighting (IPCW) and inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) analysis.
